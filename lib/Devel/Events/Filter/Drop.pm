=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Devel::Events::Filter::Drop;

	my $f = Devel::Events::Filter::Drop->new(
		match        => $cond, # see Devel::Events::Match
		non_matching => 1,     # invert so that nonmatching events get dropped
		handler      => $h,
	);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This filter allows dropping of events that match (or that don't match) a
condition. The actual matching is done by L<Devel::Events::Match>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item match

The condition to be passed to L<Devel::Events::Match/compile_cond>.

=item matcher

An instance of L<Devel::Events::Match> used to compile C<match>.

=item non_matching

Drop events that don't match the condition, instead of ones that do.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item filter_event @event

Delegates to the compiled condition and then returns the event unaltered or
returns nothing based on the values of C<non_matching> and the result of the
match.
