=head1 SYNOPSIS

	my $g = Devel::Events::Generator::LineTrace->new( handler => $h );

	$g->enable();

	# every line of code will fire an event until

	$g->disable();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Devel::Events> generator will fire line tracing events using C<DB::DB>,
a perl debugger hook.

Only one instance may be enabled at a given time. Use
L<Devel::Events::Handler::Multiplex> to deliver events to multiple handlers.

=head1 EVENTS

=over 4

=item executing_line

When the generator is enabled, this event will fire for every line of code just
before it is executed.

Lines in a package starting with C<Devel::Events::> will not be reported.

=over 4

=item package

The package the line is in.

=item file

The file of the line being executed.

=item line

The line number of the line being executed.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item enable

Enable this generator instance, disabling any other instance of
L<Devel::Events::Generator::LineTrace>.

=item disable

Stop firing events.

=item line

Called by C<DB::DB>. Used to generate the event.

=back

=head1 CAVEATS

Apparently this must be run under C<perl -d>. This is very strange, since
L<Devel::Events::Generator::SubTrace> doesn't need the C<-d> flag set.

The L<Enbugger> module can help overcome this limitation.
